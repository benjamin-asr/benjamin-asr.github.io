1. specify a category name by pressing `S`.

    HINT:
    Category name is used to distinguish a single set of voice samples. A good name could be your microphone name such as `Sennheiser PC7` or the place which the samples are recorded like `Bijan-house`

2. Start recording by pressing `space`.

    INFO:
    When the recording starts couple of words will be shown up on the screen. The default setting is 3 words and you have 3 seconds to say them. The time will be shown up on the screen. For best performance try to say the words not close to the edges, so give a small pause after start and try to finish up 200ms before time up.
