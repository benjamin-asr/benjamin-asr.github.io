2. Start to record by pressing `space`.

    INFO:
    When the recording starts couple of words will be shown up on the screen. The default setting is 3 words and you have 3 seconds to say them. The time will be shown up on the screen. For best performance try to say the words not close to the edges, so give a small pause after start and try to finish up 0.2 second before time up.
