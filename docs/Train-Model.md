1. After recording enough samples, train your model by Pressing `T`.

    HINT:
    At any time outside of terminal, by pressing `P` or clicking on `Console` tab, you can access the results of running train scripts in terminal.

2. Wait for `Generate Enn Sample` dialog to show up, this could take a while. Select `No` in the two following dialogs.

    HINT:
    Generate Enn Samples is only required for training neural network. If you are a newcomer you can skip this for now. Next dialog is also only used in advanced mode. So you should be fine skipping both of them as mentioned. To learn more about these two features please checkout [Advanced Training](Advanced-Training.md).
