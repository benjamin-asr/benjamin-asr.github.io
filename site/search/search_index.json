There is a bar, top of application below title bar, that has most useful shortcuts. Also if you want to see all shortcuts, by clicking / a help window will appear. If this is your first time using Benjamin, You need to train a model from your voice. Now it's time to follow the main steps of using this application. Record Samples First you should specify a category to work with. As a new user there isn't any categories on your computer so by clicking S enter a category name. Then start to record by clicking space . Say the words specified between <> while status is Rec . You can pause the Record procedure any time by using space and get out of record panel by pressing Escape . Then Statistics will be updated. Arbitrary name of category. Record list showing the samples recorded. Word list showing how many samples include the specific word. sample count in specific category. Detailed description about record parameters and procedure can be found in User Guide Train on Samples After recording appropriate number of samples, you are ready to experience the first Benjamin train. Press T and the terminal will show up. At any time outside of terminal, by pressing P you can access the results of running train scripts in terminal. All the train procedure is automatic and you should only wait for the dialog indicating train is finished and now it's ENN samples generation turn. Detailed description about train steps and procedure can be found in User Guide Verification When you are using Benjamin regularly, many samples will generate when issueing commands. all of these samples are useful for training, but you need to assure that these samples are matched with expected words. for verifying such samples you can press V and to change the category to unverified and press space to play the sample. You can press Z to delete sample while playing, or at Decide Pause status after voice stopped. By default after playing each sample in unverified category, if there wasn't key press, the sample will be copied from unverified to online category. you can change this behaviour by pressing R .

Record Record Status Record Parameters Record Shortcuts Train Procedure Verify Verify Status Verify Parameters Verify Shortcuts Record While recording the samples for training voice recognition engine, you should know status, parameters and shortcuts related to recording. Record Status Rec : Records your voice Pause : Pause the Recording Procedure Stop : Stop the record and navigate to statistics panel. Req Pause : Requested pause will be commited after recording finished Break : Time to let you read the words before recording started Record Parameters Category: these are directories to classify samples you record with different devices. exceptions are unverified , online and efalse that they are used by Benjamin. Pause Time: Break time that let you read the words before record started. Num of Words: Specify the number of words to display while recording. Rec Time: Defines the period of recording time. Tune this parameter with Num of Words . Count: Set this to total number of samples you want to record. Focus Word: Displayed set of words will contain the Focus Word . Power: After recording sample power of the voice will be displayed. Care about this parameter as this will be very low if recording device has any problem. Time: Shows how much time passed from Rec Time Word: Shows the words you should say while recording Status: Shows recording status Record Shortcuts S : Set Category , unverified and efalse are prohibited. Dialog will be shown and ask for desired Category . You can create a new Category or change between categories produced in past. Space : Start or Pause recording. Up/Down : Increase/Decrease Pause Time . Right/Left : Increase/Decrease Rec Time . C : Change count, dialog will be opened and ask for how many samples would you record. F : Set Focus Word , then displayed words collection will contain Focus Word . Dialog will be opened and ask for id of Focus Word . J/K : Decrease/Increase Num of Words . O : Opens selected Category directory. Train Verify By using Benjamin regularly, many samples will be created as online samples. But these samples are not labeled correctly. There is maybe some mistakes among words from a sample. These samples are accumulated in unverified directory and by verifying them, they will be moved to online directory. Verification is done by playing the samples in unverified directory. you can refer to this section to know all status, parameters and shortcuts related to verification. Verify Status Play : Play unverified samples Pause : Pause the playing sample Stop : Stop the record and navigate to statistics panel. Decide Pause : After each sample stopped from playing, there is a short time you can decide on what should happen to the sample Break : Time to let you read the words before playing started Verify Parameters Pause Time: Break time that let you read the words before record started. Status: Shows playing status Focus Word: By setting this, Player will only play the samples that contain the Focus Word . Count: Shows how many samples are in the unverified directory. By setting Focus Word , counts only samples that contain the word. Word: Shows the words you will check in the sample Time: Shows how much time passed from voice sample Power: Before playing sample, power of the voice will be displayed. Care about this parameter as this will be very low if recording device has any problem. Category is set to unverified and cannot be changed. Count is calculated from samples statistics and you cannot change it. Verify Shortcuts Space : Start or Pause playing. Up/Down : Increase/Decrease Pause Time .
