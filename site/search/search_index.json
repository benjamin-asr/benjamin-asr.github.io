There is a topbar in the application, that list most useful shortcuts. To see all shortcuts, press / . First step is to train a model from your voice. Record Samples specify a category name by pressing S . category name is used to distinguish between speaker or microphone. Start to record by pressing space . Say the words specified between <> while status is Rec . You can pause the Record procedure any time by using space and get out of record panel by pressing Escape . Then Statistics will be updated. Arbitrary name of category. Record list showing the samples recorded. Word list showing how many samples include the specific word. sample count in specific category. Detailed description about record parameters and procedure can be found in User Guide Train Model After recording around 10 x Wordlist samples, you are ready to train your first model by Pressing T . At any time outside of terminal, by pressing P you can access the results of running train scripts in terminal. All the train procedure is automatic and you should only wait for the dialog indicating train is finished and now it's ENN samples generation turn. Detailed description about train steps and procedure can be found in User Guide Verification When you are using Benjamin regularly, samples will be generated when issueing commands. all of these samples are useful for training, but you need to assure that these samples are matched with detected words. for verifying such samples you can press V to change verification mode and press space to start verification process. If the sample is wrong press Z to delete sample while playing, or at Decide Pause status after voice stopped. By default after playing each sample in unverified category, if there wasn't any key press, the sample will be verified. you can change this behaviour by pressing R .

Time: Shows how much time passed from Rec Time Word: Shows the words you should say while recording Status: Shows recording status Record Shortcuts S : Set Category , unverified and efalse are prohibited. Dialog will be shown and ask for desired Category . You can create a new Category or change between categories produced in past. Space : Start or Pause recording.
