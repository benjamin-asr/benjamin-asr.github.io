Select Your Word List: 0-20 mins First decide if you want to train a full model(takes about a week to record all the required samples) or a demo model(less than an hour). If you are a new user, we recommended to start with a demo model to checkout the accuracy and get an idea of the process. Demo: Keep all the numbers from zero to nine, remove all other words in the vocabulary. 2 mins Default: No changes need to be made. 0 min Custom: Add or remove words as you please. However keep in mind that to achieve decent performance from the engine, you need to train Count^2 samples, where Count represents the number of words in your word list. 20 mins 2. Record Audio Samples: 1hr / 1week The number of samples depend on the user but generally the more the merrier. Sample means an audio .wav file consisted of three spoken words. Hint Demo Model: 400 samples . Full Model: At least 5K samples . 3. Train a Model: 30 mins Open Gym and train a model. 4. Learn How to Use and Improve the Model Next step is to learn how to control mouse and keyboard and other special features. Benjamin also records all the samples while you use the software so you can later train on these samples too.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Requirements/","text":"Requirements \uf0c1 Operating system: Windows 10 22H2, Windows 11, Linux(Advanced) Access level: Need administrator user account with disabled UAC CPU: Intel I5 10500 RAM: 2 GB GPU: Not required Info Linux is supported, but requires extra steps to set up.

Pause Time : Break time that lets you read the words before record process starts. Num of Words : Specify the number of words for recording samples. Rec Time : Defines the period of recording time. Count : Set this to the total number of samples you want to record in a single round. Focus Word : A displayed set of words will contain the Focus Word .

Time : Shows how much time passed from Rec Time Word : Shows the words you should say while recording Status : Shows recording status Record Shortcuts \uf0c1 S : Set Category , unverified and efalse are prohibited. A dialog will be shown and ask for the desired Category . You can create a new Category or change between categories produced in the past. Space : Start or Pause recording. Up/Down : Increase/Decrease Pause Time . Right/Left : Increase/Decrease Rec Time . C : Change count, a dialog will be opened and ask for how many samples would you record. F : Set Focus Word , then the displayed words collection will contain Focus Word . A dialog will be opened and ask for the id of Focus Word . W : Opens a dialog to ask Num of Words . O : Opens selected Category directory. Verify \uf0c1 By using Benjamin regularly, many samples will be created as online samples. However, these samples are not labeled correctly. There may be some mistakes among words from a sample. These samples are accumulated in unverified directory and by verifying them, they will be moved to online directory. Verification is done by playing the samples in unverified directory. you can refer to this section to know all status, parameters and shortcuts related to verification. Verify Shortcuts \uf0c1 Space : Start or Pause playing. Up/Down : Increase/Decrease Pause Time . F : Set Focus Word , then the displayed words collection will contain Focus Word . A dialog will be opened and ask for the id of Focus Word . O : Opens unverified directory. Z : Press to move the sample from the unverified directory to the wrong directory. R : Changes default decision/action for verifying samples. Copy mode means after the Decide Pause timeout, the sample will be copied to the online directory. In the same way in Delete mode, timeout will cause sample removal. Sleep \uf0c1 Verify samples recorded in sleep mode. In this mode listen to the recorded samples, if they contain any true samples press Z to get rid of them. All other samples will automatically moved to the wrong directory and they will be used to train the enn model. Wrong \uf0c1 These are verified samples from the sleep directory. They are verified to be wrong samples, not true ones! In this mode, you will be able to review them and check if some samples are moved to this directory by accident. False \uf0c1 During generating Enn samples, some of the samples in the train directory will not detect correctly, these samples will be moved to the efalse directory. In this mode, you can listen to these samples and judge whether they are real samples or the wrong ones which you should get rid of them. Test \uf0c1 After training on samples, the model is evaluated through test samples. Word error rate (WER) and Sentence error rate (SER) are calculated by predicting test samples. Then false detected samples are listed in this tab and you can listen to them to figure out what went wrong. Enn False \uf0c1 BaTool generates enn samples, from both train samples and wrong samples. The enn directory is the destination of this process. Enn files from the train directory are located in enn/true and wrong directory-related files are in enn/false . In the Enn False tab, only false statistics are shown. By clicking the trash icon, all Enn samples will be deleted. Console \uf0c1 Training on samples is started by pressing T . After training is finished, a dialog pops up and asks to generate enn samples from audio samples. Neural Network will be trained from these enn samples. When generating Enn Samples is finished, another dialog arises and asks about verifying generated engine false detected samples. Engine false detected samples, abbreviated as efalse samples, are collected in the efalse directory. They are generated after training, and while testing samples in the test directory. You can verify them by switching to False and Test tabs. Stat \uf0c1 Arbitrary name of category. Record list showing the samples recorded.

The enn directory is the destination of this process. Enn files from the train directory are located in enn/true and wrong directory-related files are in enn/false .

After training is finished, a dialog pops up and asks to generate enn samples from audio samples. Neural Network will be trained from these enn samples. When generating Enn Samples is finished, another dialog arises and asks about verifying generated engine false detected samples. Engine false detected samples, abbreviated as efalse samples, are collected in the efalse directory. They are generated after training, and while testing samples in the test directory.
